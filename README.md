# emClarity

Releasing the developmental branch of emClarity out into the wild. We've alread started kicking things up a notch with the first couple of bug fixes/ pushes to the developmental branch from the first official emClarity collaborator : )

Will you be next?

All you need is a git hub account, and you can improve the code or even just the docs (like this readme which needs all the help!)
